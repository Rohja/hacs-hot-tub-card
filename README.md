# Hot Tub Card

Hot Tub card initially made for my Balboa-based Hot Tub connected to BWALink/MQTT using a RS485/IP adapter.

It works with the following entities:

- Pump (0 = off, 1 or 2 = on)
- Blower (on/off)
- Light (on/off + rgb - Mine is a WLED instance).
- Desired Temp (number)
  And the following sensors:
- Filter 1 (on/off)
- Filter 2 (on/off)
- Heater (on/off)
- Current Temp (number)
- Outdoor Temp (number)
